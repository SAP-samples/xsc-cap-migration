# Data Migration Configuration
Migrating from SAP HANA database to SAP HANA Cloud requires a dedicated user in your SAP HANA source database.
A dedicated user is required for the migration to run for which the user must be created or necessary privileges must be granted to an existing user in your SAP HANA source database. Follow the below steps to assign the privileges:

1. Login into your source HANA system With Administrator User.

2. Open the SQL Console.

3. (optional) Create a data migration user by executing the following statement:
   
   **Note:** Before executing the statement, replace ```<password>``` with a password that complies with the default SAP HANA password policy. It must have at least 8 characters and comprise of at least one uppercase letter, atleast one lowercase letter and atleast one number.
   
   ```
   CREATE USER <username> PASSWORD <password> NO FORCE_FIRST_PASSWORD_CHANGE;
   ```

4. Grant the necessary privileges to the data migration user. To do that, run the following script in an SQL Console in your source HANA system:

   ```
   GRANT SELECT ON _SYS_REPO.DELIVERY_UNITS TO <username>;
   GRANT SELECT ON _SYS_REPO.ACTIVE_OBJECT TO <username>; 
   GRANT CATALOG READ TO <username>;
   GRANT INIFILE ADMIN TO <username>;
   GRANT TRUST ADMIN TO <username>;
   GRANT CERTIFICATE ADMIN TO <username>;
   GRANT CREATE REMOTE SOURCE TO <username>;
   GRANT EXPORT TO <username>;
   GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.EXPORT_CATALOG_FOR_MIGRATION_DEV TO <username>;
   DO BEGIN
   	SELECT * FROM PUBLIC.M_SERVICES WHERE SERVICE_NAME = 'diserver';
   	IF ::ROWCOUNT != 0
   	THEN
   		EXEC 'CREATE LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE #PRIVILEGES LIKE _SYS_DI.TT_API_PRIVILEGES';
   		EXEC 'INSERT INTO #PRIVILEGES (PRINCIPAL_NAME, PRIVILEGE_NAME, OBJECT_NAME) SELECT ''<username>'', PRIVILEGE_NAME, OBJECT_NAME FROM _SYS_DI.T_DEFAULT_DI_ADMIN_PRIVILEGES';
   		EXEC 'CALL _SYS_DI.GRANT_CONTAINER_GROUP_API_PRIVILEGES_WITH_GRANT_OPTION(''_SYS_DI'', #PRIVILEGES, _SYS_DI.T_NO_PARAMETERS, ?, ?, ?)';
   		EXEC 'DROP TABLE #PRIVILEGES';
   		EXEC 'GRANT SELECT ON _SYS_DI.TT_API_PRIVILEGES to <username>';
   		EXEC 'GRANT SELECT ON _SYS_DI.T_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_GROUP_ADMIN_PRIVILEGES to <username>';
   		EXEC 'GRANT SELECT ON _SYS_DI.T_NO_PARAMETERS to <username>';
   	END IF;
   END;
   GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA _SYS_STATISTICS TO <username>;
   GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA _SYS_BI TO <username>;
   ```

5. The data migration user should also have the necessary privileges for each source schema that has to be migrated. To grant that execute the following query:
   
   ```
   GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA "<SCHEMA_NAME>" TO <username>;
   ```
   
6. **Note:** If the Source HANA Database is in the Neo environment, then execute the following query:
   
   ```
   GRANT SAP_INTERNAL_HANA_SUPPORT TO <username>; -- Only required when migrating SAP HANA databases in the Neo environment
   ```
   
   
**Note:** 
   
   To grant the necessary privileges for migration using the HANA Cloud self-service migration tool, the target HDI container schema must be accessible by the database user performing the migration. Use the following SQL commands to grant these privileges and run it in the target HANA Cloud database system:
   
   ```
   CREATE LOCAL TEMPORARY COLUMN TABLE #PRIVILEGES LIKE _SYS_DI.TT_SCHEMA_PRIVILEGES;
INSERT INTO #PRIVILEGES(PRIVILEGE_NAME, PRINCIPAL_SCHEMA_NAME, PRINCIPAL_NAME) 
VALUES ('SELECT', '', '<DB_USER>');
CALL <TARGET_SCHEMA>#DI.GRANT_CONTAINER_SCHEMA_PRIVILEGES(#PRIVILEGES, _SYS_DI.T_NO_PARAMETERS, ?, ?, ?);
DROP TABLE #PRIVILEGES;
   ```
   
Replace <DB_USER> with the appropriate HANA Cloud database user and <TARGET_SCHEMA> with the target schema name.

   
Once the necessary privileges are assigned, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Command palette and type, “SAP HANA Application Migration Assistant” and select the command when it appears.

7. Enter the Hana cloud target schema in the next field.

8. In the next field as shown below, enter the data migration user name which was created earlier and for which the necessary privileges were granted. Make sure the user already exists else a error message will be thrown to create the user and assign necessary privileges.

9. Click on the finish button.



After completing the above steps, proceed with the Self Service Migration tool to migrate your SAP HANA database to SAP HANA Cloud. Use the Data Migration User created in Step 3 to start the migration process.
